# Gym Management System

# Problem Statement:

Payment receipts at many Gyms are printed on paper. As a result, keeping all of the paper receipts safe is tough for both gym members and gym trainers. When members misplace their receipts, it might cause problems. Another issue that a gym owner may have is that manually distributing messages about the gym's working and non-working days becomes tough. These issues can be solved if there is an online application available.

This project can benefit both gym owners and gym users. Because all receipts are stored in a digital format in this program, there is no risk of losing any confidential receipts. This program will also alert the user (gym members) of their fees, as well as the gym owner of payment receipts. In the future, this app could be expanded to include a supplement store, nutrition advice, personal training, and other features.
